# Single-cell data analysis

Code for the single-cell data analysis in Section 6.4 is in the notebook [pbmc.ipynb](pbmc.ipynb). The pre-processing is performed in the R Markdown file [preprocessing.Rmd](preprocessing.Rmd). The file [filtered_gene_expression.zip](filtered_gene_expression.zip) contains the pre-processed data matrix. The file [cell_types.csv](cell_types.csv) contains the annotated cell types.
